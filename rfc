Abstract

   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed
   for small code size and small message size.  CBOR Object Signing and
   Encryption (COSE) defines a set of security services for CBOR.  This
   document defines a countersignature algorithm along with the needed
   header parameters and CBOR tags for COSE.  This document updates RFC
   9052.

   This document is a product of the COSE Working Group of the IETF.

   The initial draft version of the specification was based to some
   degree on the outputs of the JOSE and S/MIME Working Groups.

   Jim Schaad passed on 3 October 2020.  This document is primarily his
   work.  Russ Housley served as the document editor after Jim's
   untimely death, mostly helping with the approval and publication
   processes.  Jim deserves all credit for the technical content.

   Jim Schaad and Jonathan Hammell provided the examples in Appendix A.

   The reviews by Carsten Bormann, Ben Kaduk, and Elwyn Davies greatly
   improved the clarity of the document.
